Description: General Method of Moments (GMM) estimators for panel data with lagged and 		differenced instruments in R. The function panelGMM estimates one-step and two-		step GMM-IV linear models for panel data. Panel-robust standard errors allowing 	for heteroskedasticity and correlation over time are calculated using the 		algorithm laid out in Chapter 22 of Cameron and Trivedi (2005).
